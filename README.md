# NFT_game
this is an  NFT Game — which is the character you play as in NFT Game Players buy  NFTs first, and then go play the game. Pretty weird, right? Buying the characters before you even play the game!

For this project I built an Web3 game that allows users to select a playable minted NFT character that they then use to play the game
